    "\n",
    "More specifically, Knuth lists the following lessons learned from sorting and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How are good algorithms discovered?\n",
    "2. Can given algorithms and programs be improved?\n",
    "3. How can the efficiency of algorithms be analyzed mathematically?\n",
    "4. How can a person choose rationally between different algorithms for the same task?\n",
    "5. In what sense can algorithms be proved \"best possible\"?\n",
    "6. How does the theory of computing interact with practical considerations?\n",
    "7. How can external memories like tapes, drums, or disks be used efficiently with large databases?"

    "<h3>Problem Definition</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing algorithmic problems like sorting, it is sometimes necessary to be precise about the problem statement. We need to answer three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the input, and how is it represented?\n",
    "2. What are the allowed operations?\n",
    "3. What is the desired output?\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to sorting,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input is a list of integers. The exact representation depends on a <i>computational model</i>. Think of the list as a C array. Note that CPython lists are implemented as C arrays of pointers.\n",
    "2. We allow comparing pairs elements of the array, and swapping pairs of elements. Later, we will discuss other operations.\n",
    "3. The output is a sorted version of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll actually see that there are some loopholes with this definition."

We sometimes refer to the number of operations used as the <i>runtime</i> when thinking of the cost as time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We count the steps involved in Bubblesort. We count compare-and-swap operations, which means that we compare two elements and swap them if they are out of order. These are also called <i>comparator</i> operations. We are doing this because it is a bit simpler than trying to count swap operations and compare operations separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "We divide the algorithm into passes according to the values of $i$. The first pass involves comparing and swapping the elements at index $j$ and $j+1$ where $j\\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-2\\}$. This involves $n-1$ compare-and-swap operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first pass, the largest element of the array is in its proper place. The second pass involves $n-2$ compare-and-swap operators. Continuing int this way we get the following table:\n",

    "\n",
