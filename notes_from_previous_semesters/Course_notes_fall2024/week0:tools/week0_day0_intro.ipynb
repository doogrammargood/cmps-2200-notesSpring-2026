    "<h2>Welcome</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for taking interest in this course. The formal study of algorithms is what separates computer science from coding. We want a framework to compare algorithms, and understand why they work and when they don't. We want to understand broad categories of known algorithms and practice applying them. Ultimately, we want to create new algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are the tools to use for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Jupyter Notebooks</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our semester's notes are adapted from Fall of 2024. They are organized into <i>notebooks</i> (like this file) and <i>cells</i> (like this block of text). Each cell is either a <i>markdown</i> (this is a markdown cell) or <i>Python</i> cell. Press shift+enter to run a cell.\n",

    "Double-click the text to see the underlying markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "markdown is a stripped-down version of html, designed to be lightweight. It allow us to embed mathematical formulas in <i>latex</i>. For example, $A+B$ is formatted more nicely than A+B. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code is an ide. It is a convenient way to view Jupyter Notebooks, and interfaces with Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Python</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language. All algorithms in this course will be written in Python. I am using Python 3.10.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Canvas</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Canvas is the learning management software. It houses all official information about this course, like grades. Gradescope interfaces with Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Gradescope</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradescope is a tool that assists in grading the homeworks. You will upload your homeworks digitally as PDFs, and we will grade it. All grading on gradescope is done by humans. The grades will be updated Canvas at least 1 week before they are due. You should create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Github</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a version-control software. Github is a centralized location where software can be stored and updated. This course does not require you to have a github account, but I may upload some materials to github for the students to access. For example, old course materials can be found here: https://github.com/doogrammargood/Discrete_Math\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Overleaf</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overleaf is a cloud-based Latex service. Latex is a system for writing technical documents, and Overleaf allows you to use this system over the cloud. You don't need to register or subscribe.\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2>Style guidelines</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We should keep a consistent style and standard throughout these notes. In particular, Python code should be written as ```x=40```, and mathematical formulae should appear in Latex, $x=40$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to follow the [Pep 8 standard](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) of Python. In particular, this means that every function should have the input and output types declared, if possible. This helps the readability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Textbooks/Resources</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many textbooks and resources about algorithms.\n",
    "1. The Art of Computer Programming\n",
    "    - This is the authoratative text on all types of algorithms, but doesn't cover parallel algorithms.\n",
    "2. Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et. al\n",
    "    - A good, detailed introduction to algorithms\n",
    "3. Algorithms: Parallel and Sequential by Umut A. Acar and Guy E. Blelloch\n",
    "    - Our resource about parallelization\n",
    "4. Parameterized Algorithms: M. Cygan\n",
    "    - A resource for an advanced topic that we will cover."
