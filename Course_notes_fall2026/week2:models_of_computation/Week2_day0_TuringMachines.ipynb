We limit our Turing machine to run for at most $poly(n)$ steps, for some polynomial $poly$.

We will see that our usual RAM machines can be simulated by Turing machines in poylnomial time (and vice versa), so it is also possible to define the complexity class $P$ using RAM machines, which are much more similar to the real computers that we are actually using.\n",

Similarly, we can obtain a class $NP$ (nondeterministic polynomial time) by limiting nondeterministic Turing Machines to run in polynomial time, meaning that the shorest \"allowable\" halting computation uses a number of steps that is at most $poly(n)$, when run on an input $n$. \n",

More specifically, it is the class of problems such that, for each problem instance $i$, there is a polynomial-length string, called a <i>certificate</i>, $c_i$, such that a Turing machine can correctly decide $i$ given input $(c_i,i)$.
